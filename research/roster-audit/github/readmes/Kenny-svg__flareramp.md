# FlareRamp

FlareRamp is a testnet-first, non-custodial XRP ↔ FXRP ramp for Flare Summer
Signal. It guides verified Core Vault minting and Coston2 redemptions:

**Check → Choose destination → Sign in Xaman → Prove with FDC → Mint FXRP**

Optional destinations after mint: Coston2 wallet, Firelight vault, or Upshift
vault (Smart Accounts `0xFE` mint-and-deposit). Reverse path: MetaMask
`redeemAmount` / `redeemWithTag` on Coston2.

## What is implemented

- Protocol-derived Core Vault destination, fees, FTSO XRP/USD quote and memo.
- Destination chooser with Firelight/Upshift vault details modal.
- User-controlled Xaman signing; no XRPL seed or private key enters FlareRamp.
- Durable operator executor with XRPL watching, FDC `XRPPayment` proofs,
  idempotent recovery, `executeDirectMinting` and `executeDirectMintingWithData`.
- Live stage progress, final FXRP balance and shareable public Proof Receipts.
- MetaMask FXRP → XRPL redeem quote + submit flow.
- Explicitly labeled recorded replay for outages; it never submits transactions.
