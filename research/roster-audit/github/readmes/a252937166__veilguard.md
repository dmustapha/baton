# VeilGuard for Safe

**Safe already controls *who* can spend. VeilGuard keeps the spending policy itself *confidential*.**

VeilGuard is a [Safe](https://safe.global) Module that enforces **encrypted**
spending policies on a treasury — a per-request auto-execution limit, a total
delegated budget and a minimum treasury reserve — evaluated inside a TEE by the
[iExec Nox](https://docs.noxprotocol.io) confidential computing protocol.

A delegate submits an **encrypted** amount. The policy is evaluated on ciphertext
and the chain only ever learns a coarse, publicly verifiable outcome:

| Outcome | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `WITHIN MANDATE` | Policy passed — a confidential ERC-7984 transfer executes immediately |
| `APPROVAL REQUIRED` | Above the auto-limit — a real 2-of-2 Safe multisig approval is required |
| `BLOCKED` | Policy violated — no funds move; the coarse reason stays private to the delegate & admin |

Exact limits, remaining budgets, thresholds and amounts are **never** revealed on-chain.
Auditors receive **scoped, immutable disclosure snapshots** — not live state.

**Live contracts on Ethereum Sepolia** · current public dApp: **https://veilguard.axiqo.xyz**.
The v1.2 Operations Desk is deployed there. Releases upload every hashed asset
first, switch `index.html` last, then verify the live footer SHA and dynamic imports.

## How it works

```
Finance Admin ──proposeMandate(encrypted limits)──▶ VeilGuardModule ◀──activate── Safe multisig

Delegate ──requestSpend(encrypted amount)──▶ policy evaluated ON CIPHERTEXT in the Nox TEE
   ├─ budget check ── safeSub          │ against the Safe's REAL confidential balance
   ├─ reserve check ─ safeSub + ge     │ (the Safe lends the module transient handle access)
   ├─ auto-limit ──── le               │
   └─ decision = nested select ──▶ funds ATOMICALLY RESERVED (encrypted zero when blocked)

anyone ──finalize(decryptionProof)──▶ proof verified on-chain ──▶ execute / escalate / block
Auditor ◀── scoped IMMUTABLE snapshot handles — never live state, never future versions
```

Key design properties:

- **Humans are viewers, never admins.** Every decrypt grant is read-only
  (`addViewer`); persistent compute access to handles is confined to the module.
- **Atomic reservation, no shadow accounting.** Admissible funds move to module
  escrow in the same transaction as the decision, evaluated against the Safe's
  *real* confidential balance — later treasury changes can't invalidate a decision.
  A blocked request reserves an encrypted zero, indistinguishable on-chain.
- **Untrusted finalization.** The Nox gateway's signed decryption proof decides the
  outcome; the keeper (or any caller) is just a courier.
- **Governance without a super-admin.** The admin can only propose and pause;
  activating, resuming and approving escalations require the Safe multisig.

## Development

Prerequisites: Node.js **22.x** (pinned in `.nvmrc` / `.node-version`) and Docker
running (the plugin boots the Nox off-chain stack locally). On Apple Silicon,
use an arm64 Node process rather than an x64/Rosetta shell; the preflight check
fails early with a clear message when the runtime is incompatible.

```sh
nvm use
npm install
npm --prefix app install
npm run check
npm run test:server                    # bounded API and Safe-serialization tests
npm test -- "$PWD/test/00-stack.test.ts" \
            "$PWD/test/10-veilguard-flows.test.ts" \
            "$PWD/test/20-audit-isolation.test.ts" \
            "$PWD/test/30-governance.test.ts"   # 17 tests on the local Nox off-chain stack
```

> Pass **absolute** test paths — `hardhat test` with a relative path can misresolve
> against `node_modules/@iexec-nox/handle` when the suite imports the handle SDK.
> With Colima, also export its socket for the Nox plugin, for example
> `DOCKER_HOST=unix://$HOME/.colima/default/docker.sock`; Docker CLI context selection
> alone is not visible to the plugin.

### Sepolia reproduction paths

#### Fresh deployment (new contracts and Safe)

```sh
# .env needs SEPOLIA_DEPLOYER_KEY, DEMO_ADMIN_KEY, DEMO_SIGNER_B_KEY,
# DEMO_DELEGATE_KEY and DEMO_AUDITOR_KEY (+ optional SEPOLIA_RPC_URL).
# Optional per-role targets: FRESH_ADMIN_TARGET_ETH,
# FRESH_SIGNER_B_TARGET_ETH, FRESH_DELEGATE_TARGET_ETH and
# FRESH_AUDITOR_TARGET_ETH.
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-sepolia.ts --network sepolia
npx hardhat run scripts/smoke-sepolia.ts  --network sepolia
npx hardhat run scripts/e2e-sepolia.ts    --network sepolia
```

To generate the four disposable roles without printing their keys, prepare a
private environment and checkpoint before copying the source into a disposable
worktree:

```sh
node scripts/create-fresh-env.mjs \
  --source .env \
  --output /absolute/private/path/fresh.env \
  --checkpoint /absolute/private/path/fresh-run.json

# Activate every generated value without echoing it. The exported values take
# precedence over the repository .env for Hardhat and all Fresh scripts.
set -a
. /absolute/private/path/fresh.env
set +a

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-sepolia.ts --network sepolia
npx hardhat run scripts/smoke-sepolia.ts  --network sepolia
npx hardhat run scripts/e2e-sepolia.ts    --network sepolia
```

The helper retains only the source Deployer identity, generates four new role
keys, writes the environment as mode `0600`, refuses existing output/checkpoint
paths and places `FRESH_RUN_CHECKPOINT_PATH` in that environment. The three
Fresh entrypoints and Hardhat itself use exported process variables before the
repository `.env`; sourcing the generated file as shown is therefore required
unless it is explicitly installed as the active `.env`.

All four `DEMO_*` role keys must be brand-new test-only identities; the deploy
preflight refuses any role that reuses a checked-in Safe owner or deployment role.

Fresh role funding uses **target balances**, not a fixed transfer. Defaults are
Admin `0.012 ETH`, signer B `0.010 ETH`, Delegate `0.012 ETH` and Auditor
`0.001 ETH`, based on a complete Deploy → Smoke → E2E run with extra testnet-gas
margin. Before the first chain write, the deploy script reads every role balance,
adds only the missing top-ups, and requires the Deployer to cover that dynamic
total plus a separate `0.02 ETH` deployment-gas reserve. For four zero-balance
roles, the default gate is therefore `0.055 ETH`; existing role balances reduce
it. Each transfer is recalculated from the latest balance and followed by an
independent balance read that must meet the configured target. Raise an individual
`FRESH_*_TARGET_ETH` value if Sepolia gas prices increase. These overrides may
raise a target but cannot lower its empirical default floor; an undercut is
rejected during the read-only preflight.

The deploy step initializes a mode-`0600`, deployment-bound Fresh checkpoint
(`.fresh-run-checkpoint.json`, or `FRESH_RUN_CHECKPOINT_PATH`). Smoke and E2E
persist each broadcast hash before receipt polling and derive every Mandate,
Request and Audit Packet ID from that transaction's event. A restart follows
the same hash and ID; a mismatched deployment or an ambiguous stage without a
hash fails closed instead of submitting a replacement transaction. Use a new,
isolated checkpoint path for every new Fresh deployment—existing recovery
evidence is never overwritten.

Fresh Nox inputs are broadcast only after the exact contract gas-estimation
path can consume them. Status resolution and downstream
`decrypt`/`publicDecrypt` are separate retry barriers, and the checkpoint
records their `resolved → usable` lag. The flow uses bounded read-only retries;
it does not rely on operator sleeps or repeated wallet submissions.

This sequence is only for a **fresh deployment**. It creates a Safe with exactly
two distinct owners and threshold `2`, then every module enable, mandate
activation, escalation approval and cancellation is signed by both owners with
real EIP-712 signatures through the shared `safeExec2of2` helper. A single owner
cannot complete any of those governance actions.

`deploy-sepolia.ts` intentionally replaces the root `deployments.json`; the smoke
and E2E scripts then exercise those newly written addresses and leave real
Sepolia/Nox evidence behind. Run this sequence in a disposable branch or worktree.
Do **not** start at `smoke-sepolia.ts` or `e2e-sepolia.ts` with the repository's
checked-in production manifest. If the dApp should target the fresh deployment,
copy the generated root manifest to `app/src/deployments.json` and run
`npm run check` before building it; otherwise leave both checked-in production
manifests untouched.

This is a **fresh protocol reproduction**, not a one-command clone of the full
public Operations Desk demo. It proves the new contracts, exact 2-of-2 Safe,
direct/escalated/blocked requests and audit snapshots with one configured
Delegate and Auditor. Copying the manifest only retargets contract and role
addresses; it does not replace the public test-only identities or provision the
guided scenarios.

To reproduce the complete public Guided Demo on the fresh deployment, also:

- choose test-only keys for the main, violation and Free Play Delegates plus the
  Auditor; keep those identities aligned between `app/src/demo.ts` and the
  provisioner demo-role settings, then rebuild the dApp. Never put the Finance
  Admin or either Safe-owner key in the browser bundle;
- fund all three Delegate accounts with Sepolia gas, seed the Safe with enough
  cUSDC, and create/activate an eligible mandate for each Delegate with the same
  three guided recipients and sufficient confidential capacity;
- run the provisioner against the fresh `MODULE` and `SAFE`, with matching
  `ADMIN_KEY`/`SIGNER_B_KEY`, RPC, Nox gateway/subgraph, allowed origin, demo
  role/recipient overrides and a durable decision journal; and
- verify `/api/demo-ready`, Approve and Reject, audit-packet creation and every
  Guided Demo mission against that environment before presenting it.

The deploy script funds only its configured Admin, second signer, one Delegate
and one Auditor. The smoke/E2E sequence creates only its single protocol-test
mandate, so neither step satisfies the additional public-demo prerequisites.

#### Existing production deployment

The checked-in root and dApp deployment manifests describe the existing public
2-of-2 Safe and production contracts. They are not inputs for the fresh-deployment
exercise above. Use the production dApp for ordinary judge flows and the manual
**Production Release Gate** workflow for a release-bound live Approve/Reject
acceptance run. That workflow requires explicit production confirmation, pins the
source and observed UI SHA, serializes real Safe mutations and emits a retained
release manifest; ordinary CI and read-only production checks never opt into it.
Do not run the fresh deploy/smoke/E2E scripts or the historical
`redeploy-module.ts` migration against the current production deployment.
The Gate does not deploy contracts, the backend or the UI. Deploy the selected
ref first, confirm that the live footer reports that ref's SHA and require ordinary
CI to pass before dispatching the production mutation Gate.

### dApp

```sh
cd app && npm install && npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
npm test                                  # Vitest + React Testing Library
npm run test:e2e                         # Playwright: 1366x768 + 390x844
npm run build                             # → app/dist (static SPA)
```

### Keeper (optional availability helper)

```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/keeper.ts --network sepolia          # one-shot sweep
KEEPER_LOOP=1 npx hardhat run scripts/keeper.ts --network sepolia   # loop
```
Systemd/cron templates: [`scripts/keeper.service.example`](./scripts/keeper.service.example).

## Confidential Operations Desk

The dApp is organized around work objects rather than disconnected role demos.
Its refresh-safe routes include `#/overview`, `#/payments`, `#/payments/:id`,
`#/policies/new`, `#/policies/:id`, `#/policies/:id/new-version`,
`#/approvals/:id`, `#/disclosure`, `#/audit/:packetId`,
`#/verify/:flowId`, `#/contracts`, `#/provenance` and `#/funds`. The guided
Launch Day run cannot skip ahead:

1. submit the 25 cUSDC CloudNode invoice and verify direct execution;
2. submit the 60 cUSDC ShieldOps request and explicitly choose Approve or Reject;
3. submit the 600 cUSDC Atlas Contractor request, verify it is blocked, and decrypt
   the private reason as its isolated Delegate;
4. review the immutable v1 disclosure scope and create the run-bound packet set;
5. unlock, review or flag every disclosed request, pass integrity checks, then
   inspect the direct, committee, blocked and audit flows in Verify.

`DemoSessionV2` binds every request and packet to one run. An unfinished run can
be resumed. Restart is refused until any old pending escalation has been really
cancelled and its escrow refund confirmed. The public view never receives
plaintext amounts, policy values or blocked reasons.

Each guided Invoice owns one immutable Attempt once its mission is strictly
complete. A newer Request with the same run memo cannot replace that Request ID
or erase its receipt, decision or disclosure identity. An incomplete Attempt is
retryable only after an authenticated timeout cancellation or an on-chain
`Expired` state; an unavailable decision attestation remains recoverable and is
never treated as permission to submit again. Completed Invoice actions open the
bound Request Detail, while “Start a new demo run” always enters the same guarded
Restart flow rather than clearing browser state directly.

Payment submission acknowledges the first click immediately and reports the
single truthful Preflight → Encrypt → Submit → Private check → Publish result
flow. The transaction hash is persisted at broadcast time; refresh recovery stays
under Submit and then matches only the current run's domain-separated memo,
scenario, mandate, delegate and recipient. Invoice drafts remain in the Inbox;
created Request IDs open a dedicated timeline, Privacy Lens, settlement and
transaction view. See
[`docs/DESIGN.md`](./docs/DESIGN.md) for the canonical interaction and recovery
contract.

Mission evidence never triggers a timed page change. The completed Receipt,
blocked reason or packet result stays visible until the visitor explicitly
continues. On mobile, action-required missions collapse to a compact rail above
the Safe decision dock instead of covering Approve or Reject.

Each action-required Launch step also has a run-aware handoff button. It applies
the required role, route and object selection together, preselects the fixed
invoice or eligible disclosure scope, and places keyboard focus plus a visible
coachmark on the one real next control. This handoff is navigation only: it never
submits a payment, decrypts a value, chooses a Safe decision or invokes a wallet.
If asynchronous content does not expose the target within 2.5 seconds, the
drawer reopens with a retryable loading message instead of spinning forever.
Multi-stage work keeps the coach attached across safe local transitions such as
Review → Create and Unlock → Review → disposition → next Packet. Consequential
submit, decrypt and Safe decision controls still require a separate explicit
click and never fire automatically. Once a Follow action begins, its busy control
retains the coach for the full bounded operation; the 2.5-second missing-target
window starts only if that control actually disappears before its successor exists.

## Real 2-of-2 demo committee

The guided ShieldOps Approve/Reject buttons select a constrained demo action;
they are not presented as the visitor's signature. Both current Safe owner keys
remain server-side and produce a real threshold-2 `execTransaction`. There is no
timer-based auto-approval: after the disclosed three-minute decision window the
only automatic action is `cancelEscalated`, which returns escrow and restores the
request budget.

The provisioner enforces narrowly scoped server interfaces:

- `POST /api/finalize` accepts one exact Request ID and returns `202` as soon as
  the idempotent proof-courier job owns it. Proof generation and the Sepolia
  receipt continue in the background; the browser keeps the Request bound,
  shows the real stage/elapsed time and reads its terminal chain state. A lost
  HTTP response is recovery, not failure, and never submits another payment.
- `POST /api/demo-ready` performs its bounded recent-Request check in one
  Multicall. The browser may retry this read-only preflight once with visible
  feedback; both attempts happen before encryption, signing or submission, so a
  timeout can never create a duplicate payment.
- `POST /api/demo-decision` accepts only the current run's pending ShieldOps
  request, exact recipient and decrypted 60 cUSDC amount. Same-action retries are
  idempotent; `202` returns the current validation/signing/broadcast/confirmation
  phase and the transaction hash as soon as it exists. `409` is a
  conflicting decision, `410` means the window expired and escrow was returned,
  and `503` refuses to sign when Finance Admin cannot decrypt and verify the amount.
- `GET /api/demo-decision?runId=…&requestId=…` is a read-only, run-bound
  attestation over the persisted decision journal. A public state-5 cancellation
  remains `Cancelled and refunded` unless this endpoint proves a matching user
  Reject; watchdog expiry is reported separately and never impersonates a user.
- `POST /api/demo-audit-packet` accepts only verified terminal requests from the
  current run, groups them by mandate and creates or reuses real on-chain packets.
  The returned bundle is explicitly a UI aggregate, never a synthetic contract object.
- `POST /api/governance-execute` replaces the removed `/api/cosign`. It verifies a
  current owner-A EIP-712 signature, canonical allow-listed module calldata and the
  latest Safe nonce before owner B co-signs and broadcasts.

The disclosure request list is a real scope selector. Guided runs may create one
or more subsets; packet IDs and covered Request IDs accumulate, and the Auditor
handoff unlocks only after CloudNode, ShieldOps and Atlas Contractor are all
covered. Packets are still grouped by mandate and the displayed bundle remains a
UI aggregate rather than a fabricated contract object.

A connected Finance Admin's complete multi-mandate packet loop holds one
resource-scoped Operation Coordinator lease for its wallet from the first nonce
read through the last receipt, reinforced by an origin-wide Web Lock. Conflicting
wallet operations remain on Review and perform no write. Immediately before
`wallet_writeContract`, the app durably records an unknown-signature marker and
starting block. A reload therefore cannot open a second prompt: it must recover a
unique matching `AuditPacketCreated` transaction from chain. A rejection caught
by the still-open page clears the pre-broadcast marker; after reload, an unknown
outcome has no user-asserted clear path and requires manual chain reconciliation.
A broadcast hash is a non-discardable recovery pointer and is checked against the
receipt, the unique event and `getAuditPacket`. Only a reverted receipt clears
that group for a new signature; fully verified success is archived before a new
scope can begin.
Guided facilitated creation continues to use the independent server-side Admin
mutex and never claims the browser wallet resource.

Policies expose the complete authority model without publishing privileged keys:
the connected Finance Admin may propose a new encrypted mandate or replacement
Draft and pause the module; a current Safe owner may activate, retire or resume
through 2-of-2 governance. Finance Admin rotation remains a managed Safe/deployment
operation outside the public automatic co-sign allowlist.

Every Safe operation shares one serialized nonce boundary from state revalidation
through receipt. In this source candidate the self-service `/api/provision` path
is disabled by default, requires an address-bound EIP-712 challenge when enabled,
and consumes restart-persistent per-address/global quota before any sponsored
write. It also remains idempotent per address and CORS-locked to the app origin.
Finance-admin and both current Safe-owner secrets are never shipped in the
browser bundle; only intentionally low-power Delegate and snapshot-Auditor
testnet keys are public. See [`server/OPERATIONS.md`](server/OPERATIONS.md) for
the required persistent paths, treasury gate and RPC broadcast policy.

These controls are not considered deployed merely because this checkout passes.
After release, acceptance must re-read `/api/health` and require the structured
`provision`, `treasury` and `rpc` sections described in the operations guide,
including `treasury.gasTopupEnabled=false` for a fail-closed release.
If those fields are absent, production is still running an older backend and
self-service provisioning must not be represented as using this hardened path.

In production, set `DEMO_DECISION_JOURNAL_PATH` to a writable persistent volume.
The journal stores the first observed approval timestamp plus terminal decision
receipts, so the three-minute window and idempotent retries survive a provisioner
restart. The OS temporary-directory default is suitable only for local development.

### Historical production acceptance

The 2026-07-19 pre-Gate production acceptance executed both visitor-selectable
outcomes as separate run-bound requests on the deployed threshold-2 Safe; these
are transaction receipts, not health-check results or client-side completion flags:

| Path | Request | Terminal proof | Safe transaction |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Approve | #35 | state 2 · `executeEscalated` · `EscalationExecuted` · `origin:user` | [`0xe5d36e…90c6`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0xe5d36e657fc77823871f72a2f6d690a9cbad35421af8a3a5e46a4f8f22c890c6) |
| Reject | #37 | state 5 · `cancelEscalated` · `EscalationCancelled` · `origin:user` | [`0x53aaf5…8c75`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x53aaf51e5874ea929740b90781f2609dca259edd6e351cf7365fb8ed6fa28c75) |

Both receipts target the deployed Safe, call the VeilGuard module with operation
0, and carry 130 signature bytes (two 65-byte owner signatures). A later manual
Gate run for source `f48627f` completed successfully with a valid manifest (its
Approve evidence was safely recovered and its Reject evidence was independently
executed). This remains historical evidence only: it does not prove any later
source or production UI SHA.

### Manual Production Release Gate

`.github/workflows/production-release-gate.yml` is intentionally separate from
ordinary pull-request CI. It becomes manually dispatchable only after the
workflow exists on the default branch. Before either live action it requires the
explicit mutation confirmation and verifies that the production UI footer SHA
equals the selected commit. The blocking order is the 17-test local Nox suite,
one `live-sepolia` desktop Approve run, then one independent Reject run; neither
action retries automatically and each has a 15-minute ceiling.

The Actions runner receives no Safe owner or Finance Admin private key. It calls
only the bounded production API, while keys remain in the production service.
Each action emits versioned JSON, trace/report files and Etherscan links; the
final manifest is retained for 90 days. If an assertion fails after broadcast,
inspect the recovery artifact before any manual rerun instead of blindly creating
another request.

A fresh release-bound run has no resume inputs:

```bash
gh workflow run production-release-gate.yml --ref <deployed-ref> \
  -f confirm_production=true
```

If Approve succeeds but the independent Reject Job fails, dispatching the Gate
with `resume_run_id` reuses the prior validated Approve evidence and runs Reject
only. A `run-started` pointer may start a fresh Reject run only when it contains
no request or transaction pointer. A `request-bound` pointer must instead resume
that exact run, Request ID and request transaction; it may never submit another
invoice. A `decision-observed` pointer is accepted only with a matching
`origin:user` Reject attestation. The live recovery rechecks current chain state
and refuses watchdog `origin:timeout`, unknown terminal state, mismatched request
evidence or conflicting action. This prevents both duplicate Safe actions and a
timeout cancellation being presented as a user's choice.

```bash
gh workflow run production-release-gate.yml --ref <deployed-ref> \
  -f confirm_production=true -f resume_run_id=<failed-run-id> -f resume_run_attempt=1
```

An uploaded manifest is not by itself a pass because the manifest Job runs with
`if: always()`. Release acceptance requires all three conditions: the workflow
concludes `success`, `release-manifest.json` has `passed: true`, and its full
`sourceCommit` equals the full commit SHA resolved from the selected ref. The
deployed UI footer must show that commit's expected short SHA prefix.

Ordinary desktop/mobile Playwright never collects the live file. It runs only
against the local app and includes deterministic dark/reduced-motion visual
baselines for Landing, Payments, Request Detail, Approval Decision, Disclosure
Builder and Audit Review at 1366×768 and 390×844. Expected images are reviewed
and committed; CI uses `threshold: 0.2` and `maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.003` and never
updates them automatically. Public reads, all three local Demo write signers and
wallet network setup use only the browser-CORS-verified dRPC, Tenderly and
PublicNode-first, Tenderly, then dRPC fallback pool; archive log reads use one
six-event OR filter per block chunk through Tenderly with dRPC fallback. System
Readiness independently verifies a reachable block, the latest Nox handle, the
real Safe threshold and module enablement instead of displaying hard-coded green
states. Provider changes and failed Nox client creation both invalidate their
account-bound cache so retry remains real.

## Security & trust model

VeilGuard provides **confidentiality, not anonymity**. Public by design:
addresses, recipients, timing, the three-state outcome and transaction hashes.
Encrypted: amounts, auto-limits, budgets, reserve floors and blocked reasons.

Confidentiality rests on the Nox protocol's TEE (Intel TDX remote attestation +
a KMS/Handle-Gateway that signs decryption proofs the chain verifies) — **not** a
zero-knowledge proof of the policy computation. The public outcome intentionally
leaks limited information (which of three states a request reached); exact limits,
balances and failure margins stay confidential. Probing is dampened by a
post-block cooldown, coarse (viewer-only) reasons, and one in-flight request per
mandate.

## Current limitations

- **Testnet prototype — not audited.** Do not use with real funds.
- **Nox ACL grants are irreversible.** `addViewer` / `allow` / public-decrypt
  cannot be revoked on-chain; audit disclosure is therefore modeled as an
  **immutable snapshot** (a fresh isolated handle), never a grant on live state.
- **Recipient addresses are public** in P0 (the allow-list is plaintext).
- **Escalation UX**: signers decrypt the amount in the VeilGuard view and confirm
  the escalated amount in the VeilGuard view; the official Safe UI does not decrypt Nox handles itself.
- The Sepolia Safe is **2-of-2**: activation and escalation decisions each require
  two distinct owner EIP-712 signatures, threshold 2. Guided-demo signatures are
  produced by the bounded server committee, not collected from separate humans via
  the Safe Transaction Service / Safe{Wallet} queue.
- The deployed v1 audit ABI always snapshots `autoLimit`, `budgetLeft` and
  `reserveFloor`, plus amount and reason for every selected request. The UI labels
  this fixed scope; per-field policy masking would require a new contract version.
- **Changing the Safe owner set does not revoke access already granted to historical
  handles** (Nox ACLs are irreversible). Propose a new policy version after owner rotation.
- Audit packets are **selective disclosure**, not a standalone compliance proof: v1
  discloses its three fixed policy snapshots plus selected request amounts and coarse
  reasons — verify the public
  request state and transaction hashes alongside them.
- The public prototype still discovers full historical Mandate and Request state
  from ID 1 on each refresh. Multicall keeps the current testnet workload bounded;
  pagination or an indexed history API is deferred until after the hackathon.
